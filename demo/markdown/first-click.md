# Good start!

Watch how the pie chart on the right changes as you click more. 

Each of your clicks shows us an interest in one of 3 categories. Of course, real social media has many more, but let's keep it simple! 

When you indicate interest in a category, it changes our **belief** about what you like. In this case, "belief" actually means a probability distribution. Look at you, you're a budding machine learning expert! Trust us, that'll make you *super* fun at cocktail parties. (Read: it will not.)

The important thing to note is that all the numbers in the pie charts are %-chances of seeing that category. And percentages have to sum to 100%!

What does that mean? It means that clicking a post will increase the chance of seeing one category and decrease the chance of seeing the others. This makes sure the the percentages sum to 100. 

This is actually how social media works! Of course, those employees do some crazy math to get super accurate percentages. And the exact math is all proprietary (that's big business-speak for a very expensive secret). 

Keep clicking and watch how your feed changes with our belief about your interests!
