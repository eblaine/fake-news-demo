# Welcome!

On your left is your newsfeed, where you'll be interacting with different types of posts
corresponding to different categories, mirroring the types of posts you may see on social media sites.

Stay on the lookout for **fake news** posts. The definition of fake news is constantly in flux, but
here it can refer to **false posts** and posts that hide some of the truth via **context manipulation** and
**sensational language**. 

On your right is your user model, which is how we see you and your interests. Each
interaction will tell us a bit more on how to curate content for you, so take notes on
how it reacts! A like, comment, or share may have slightly different impacts.

Go ahead, try interacting with your newsfeed!
