# Welcome!

On your left is your newsfeed, where you'll be interacting with different types of posts
corresponding to different categories (just 3 to keep it simple), 
mirroring the types of posts you may see on social media sites:

![#90ed7d](https://placehold.it/15/90ed7d/000000?text=+) Animals    
![#7cb5ec](https://placehold.it/15/7cb5ec/000000?text=+) Liberal    
![#434348](https://placehold.it/15/434348/000000?text=+) Conservative   

Stay on the lookout for **fake news** posts. The definition of fake news is constantly in flux, but
here it can refer to **false posts** and posts that hide some of the truth via **context manipulation** and
**sensational language**. 

On your right is your user model, which is how we see you and your interests. Each
interaction will tell us a bit more on how to curate content for you, so take notes on
how it reacts! A like, comment, or share may have slightly different impacts.

Go ahead, try interacting with your newsfeed!
