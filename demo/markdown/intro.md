# Welcome!

On your left is your newsfeed, where you'll be interacting with different types of posts
corresponding to different categories, mirroring the types of posts you may see on social media sites.

On your right is your user model, which is how the site sees you and your interests. Each
interaction will tell the site a bit more on how to curate content for you, so take notes on
how it reacts!

Go ahead, try interacting with your newsfeed!
