# Woah there!

Looks like one of your interests just went to zero! 

That means you won't see any more of those posts, and other categories
will be more dominant on your feed! As a result, your echo chamber is becoming
more restrictive on what type of content you'll see.

On a real social media site, this would mean that even if *all* your friends were
sharing content in that category, you would never see it! Isn't that sad?
