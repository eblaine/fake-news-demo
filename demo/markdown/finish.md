# Thanks for interacting with our Echo Chamber!

Hopefully you saw how easily your interactions affected your feed, exposing
you to certain types of posts that aligned with your history of interactions with
the site. Keep in mind that our simulation was oversimplified and pretty transparent;
today's social media sites aren't so explicit with how they decide what you see and 
what you don't see! Especially with the rise of clickbait titles, false reporting, 
and "fake news" in general, our newsfeeds can be manipulated in ways we might not realize.

Keep that in mind, and stay mindful of the content you interact with and how that 
might affect your social media experience!

We hope you've been able to learn something from us!

Best,
Ellen, Julia, and Miguel
