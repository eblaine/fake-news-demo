# FAKE NEWS EXPLAINED: ECHO CHAMBERS

Welcome to our Echo Chamber simulator! 

An echo chamber is a metaphorical description where beliefs and ideas get reinforced
or amplified because of continuous exposure and repetition in a system, much like
how sound may echo and reflect sound in a hollow chamber.  

Through this simulator, you'll be able to interact with posts as you normally 
would on any social media platform and explore how each interaction may affect
what posts are exposed to you. If you're not careful, these posts will eventually 
be heavily skewed towards your expressed interests.

We're going to be simple and explicit here: you'll be able to see how the site
views your interests and how that changes your feed, which is a bit more 
transparent than current social media sites.

So, the first step is to sign up and create a profile. Let's get started!
