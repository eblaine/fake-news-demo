# FAKE NEWS EXPLAINED: ECHO CHAMBERS

Welcome to our Echo Chamber simulator! 

An **echo chamber** is a metaphorical description, where beliefs and ideas get reinforced
because of continuous exposure and repetition in a system, much like
how sound may echo in a hollow chamber.  

Through this simulator, you'll be able to interact with posts as you normally 
would on any social media platform and explore how each interaction may affect
the posts exposed to you. If you're not careful, these posts will eventually 
be heavily skewed towards what the site infers your interests to be.

We're going to be simple and explicit here: you'll be able to see how the site
views your interests and how that changes your feed. We're being a bit more 
transparent than current social media sites.

Our goal is to help you visualize how echo chambers arise, and help you on your way
to thinking more carefully about your own social media activity in the future.

So, the first step is to sign up and create a profile. Let's get started!
